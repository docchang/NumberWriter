Number Writer - Given a positive number integer, compute the written text for the number. Number can be from 0 - 10,000,000,000,000 (10 trillion)


Problem approach: I created the "ThousandWriter" which takes in single digits of hundred, ten, single. Using the predefined strings I was able to execute this.

I proceed breaking down the problem recursively by having each thousand as one level.

Induction Base cases:
Number=0,Level=0 -> return "Zero"
Number=0 -> return ""

Inductive Step:
Append the current string from "ThousandWriter" to the result of the recursion.
